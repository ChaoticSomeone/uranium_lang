Features:
	- shorthand assignments

XML:
	- Allow various kinds of syntax (e.g. function/variable identifier)
	  alternatively we could introduce another class for tokens

Optimizations:
	- Make all code that uses the generated tokens use specified toke groups instead of the one that contains all tokens
	- the new parser should only check relevant syntax for each token, not all syntaxes

Lexer:
/

Parser:
	(- currently rewriting the entire parser )
	- implement all syntax files
	- recursive syntax checking
	- type checking

Compiler:
/

Builtins:
	(the below three fixes have to do with templates/generics)
	- fix uranium::io.read
	- fix uranium::random.randint
	- fix uranium::random.randfloat

Installer:
	- Move *.xml files to the install dir
